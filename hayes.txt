The hayes program for linux is a small hayes modem emulator. hayes
is very small because it only handles the terminal side, AT commands
and the in-band <0.5s>+++<0.5s>

The delay time of 0.5 seconds can only be changed in hayes.c

Make sure that the tty used for the terminal side has reasonable
editing settings:

	stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 sane
	hayes -t /dev/ttyUSB0

should do.

Hayes commands are:

ATDTcommand    connect
ATH            hangup
ATO            online
ATE            echo
ATV            verbose
AVQ            quiet
ATI            information
ATZ            reset

ATX            exit
AT?            help

command is the command which connects. Examples:

ATDTtelnet 3corners.us
ATDTssh fred@home

nc is another candidate. bash can be used to provide a local shell.
