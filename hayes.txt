The hayes program for linux is a small hayes modem emulator. hayes
is very small because it only handles the terminal side, AT commands
and the in-band <1s>+++<1s>

The delay time of 1 second can only be changed in the hayes source.

Hayes commands are:

ATDTcommand    connect
ATH            hangup
ATO            online
ATE            echo
ATV            verbose
AVQ            quiet

ATX            exit
AT?            help

command is the command which connects. Examples:

ATDTtelnet 3corners.us
ATDTssh fred@home

nc is another candidate. bash can be used to provide a local shell.
